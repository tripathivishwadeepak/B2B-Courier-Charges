**B2B Courier Charges**

**Project Overview**

In the fast-paced world of e-commerce, timely and efficient order delivery is critical for business success. To streamline order fulfillment, many businesses rely on courier companies to ship products to their customers. However, managing and reconciling the shipping charges from these third-party couriers can be a complex challenge, especially when handling a high volume of orders.

A common issue faced by B2B businesses is the discrepancy between the estimated and actual shipping charges for the same invoice. This misalignment can cause confusion and lead to operational inefficiencies. This project aims to address this real-time challenge by providing a solution to ensure accurate and consistent charge reconciliation, helping businesses save time and reduce errors.
